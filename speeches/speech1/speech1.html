    <h4>They are kinda low res but that's just because i made them 32x32 then just scaled them up so they weren't super tiny on the site lol.</h4>
    <h4>I also just posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/kNq1pbAFurE?si=2TDlmXVetVwwAmRy">new youtube video</a> but other than that, nothing else has been going on that is of note. School's going pretty smoothly so far and I have no complaints. Here's hoping I have a breezy semester.</h4>
