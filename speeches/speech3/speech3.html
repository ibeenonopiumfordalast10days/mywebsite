<h2>Hello all</h2>
<h3>It has really been a long time since I have updated the site and made a speech to the endless void of the internet about what I have been doing so I figured that I should check in.</h3>

<h3>Still working the same job and still going to school for the same thing, but I would rather talk about something cooler so lets move on.</h3>

<h3>Firstly, as you may or may not be able to tell, I have updated the look of the site. Just hopped into photoshop and made some weird letters and background. It doesnt look amazing or anything but i think it is endearing and cutesey so imma leave it like this for now. However, I plan on leaving all of the logos and everything the exact same from how I made them during the speeches so that is why the old ones look different, and also why i used the old home background on this one.</h3>

<h3>I learned how to put embedded links and shit on the site so ive been spamming it wherever I can. I also made some new music as you can see by the song I linked. I made pretending it was from the Bombrush Cyberfunk soundtrack since I started playing that game and was having a lot of fun with it.</h3>

<h3> I also made a new <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iboofdl10d/">Instagram Account</a> that I am using to post my weird photoshoppy art on. Already got some motion on there(9 followers) so thats pretty cool.</h3>

<h3>I have also been really getting into fashion and shit recently so ive been thrifting on and off for a few months now trying to really build my wardrobe. Thrifting has honestly become one of my favorite things to do, i just wish there were more places to do it where I live. I might start posting fit pics on my actual ig, if I do, you will see them on here too.</h3>

<h3>Also picked up a bike, which is pretty awesome. I have never owned a bike before so it has been really fun just riding around exploring my small town, finding cool areas I never knew existed.</h3>

<h3>I started going to the gym again as well trying to watch what i eat more. I am no like mega obese or anything, just tryna get a little more toned ykwis.</h3>

<h3>Anyway, I will end this off by saying that life is good and you should live it the way you want to. Do not let people tell you what you can and cant do, be you gang. Also i shouldve probably been dating these but whatever. STARTS NOW</h3>
